GIoTTO Machine Learning Layer Documentation
=============================================

This document describes the machine learning layer in GIoTTO stack.
The machine learning layer provides functionality that allows users to create and use
virtual sensors. Virtual sensors are essentially machine learning classifiers
that make predictions based on sensor readings from real sensors.

This machine learning layer works on top of Building Depot and provide REST APIs for
creating and training machine learning classifiers and making predictions using
the trained classifiers.
